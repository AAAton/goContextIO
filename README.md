# goContextIO

A simple golang <a href="https://context.io" target="_blank">Context.IO</a> client library.  Primarily all it does is
sign the requests made to Context.IO with your key and secret.  This allows you to make requests to Context.IO endpoints and either
get an \*http.request object back for parsing, or just the json response.

Docs are available at http://godoc.org/github.com/dmlyons/goContextIO.
